                <ul class="inglist">
                    <li>2 1/4 cups warm water</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon instant or active dry yeast</li>
                    <li>3/4 tablespoon salt</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, canola oil, vegetable oil or avocado oil</li>
                    <li>5 1/2 - 6 cups (781 - 852 g) all-purpose flour or bread flour</li>
                </ul>
            <h3 class="directions">Directions</h3>
                <ol class="dirlist">
                    <li>In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the water sugar and yeast. If
                        using active dry yeast, let the mixture bubble and foam before proceeding (this can take 3-5 minutes).
                        If using instant yeast, proceed with the recipe (no need to let the yeast activate).</li>
                    <li>Add the salt, oil and 3 cups of flour and mix. Add in 2 1/2 to 3 more cups of flour gradually. The dough
                        should clear the sides of the bowl and form a soft ball that doesn't leave a lot of dough residue on your
                        fingers. Knead for 2-3 minutes until the dough is smooth. If the dough starts to cling to the sides of the
                        bowl (or the center column if using a Bosch or other mixer with a center), add 1/4 cup of flour at a time
                        until a sturdy but soft ball of dough forms.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl and cover with a towel or greased plastic wrap. Let the
                        dough rise until doubled, about an hour or so, depending on the warmth of your kitchen.</li>
                    <li>Turn the dough onto a lightly greased surface and divide in half. Pat each section into a thick rectangle,
                        9X13-inches or thereabouts (doesn't have to be exact). Roll the dough up starting from the long edge,
                        pressing out any air bubbles or seams with the heel of your hand, and pinch the edge to seal. Arrange
                        seam side down on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper (I use separate baking sheets for
                        each loaf). You can slash several gashes in the top of the bread now or wait until after it has risen.</li>
                    <li>Cover with greased plastic wrap or a kitchen towel, and let the loaves rise until noticeably puffy and
                        nearly doubled in size, about an hour.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F and make sure an oven rack is in the center position. If you haven't
                        already, with a very sharp knife or baker's lame cut several gashes at an angle on the top of each loaf.</li>
                    <li>Place the baking sheet in the hot oven and immediately toss 3-4 ice cubes on the bottom of
                        the oven (this gives a delicious, classic, French bread crispness to the crust). Close the oven door
                        quickly.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden and baked through. Remove from the oven and slather with melted
                        butter (optional, but delicious). Repeat with the 2nd loaf (or if you have convection setting, the loaves
                        can bake at the same time, just rotate the baking sheets halfway through baking).</li>
